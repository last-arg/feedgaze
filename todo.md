# Initial
- website:
  - minify html
  - purge and minify css
  - need to url escape link paths?
  - server: limit inline icon size
- if link and id are same only save link to save space
- try std lib compression
- https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25495
  - This should hopefully fix newer zig builds or point to what the problem is
  - for now use '.use_llvm = true' to avoid
- explore zig std lib http client
  - out of all feed urls 2 failed
    - https://www.openmymind.net/atom.xml. Error: error.ConnectionTimedOut
    - https://news.ycombinator.com/rss. Error: error.TlsInitializationFailed
- Add sqlite table for failed feed requests?
- 'https://mastodon.social/@deech'. Error: error.NoHtmlOptions
- 'https://infosec.exchange/@letoram'. Error: error.NoHtmlOptions


- Make sqlite returned primary keys into u64.
  - Use zig's enums to create a newtype? https://matklad.github.io/2025/03/19/comptime-zig-orm.html
- failed feed requests
  - keep count how many times feed has failed to fetch?
  - save date when it failed first time? Or last?
  - https://jamesg.blog/2024/12/24/designing-the-artemis-feed-recovery-tool/
- when two commands run at the same time there is possibility of getting
sqlite busy error
- cli: 
  - try https://github.com/n0s4/flags

- icons 
  - compress (gzip/br) .ico and svg?
    - If I request gzip/br I should not have to compress myself
    - If there is no compressed icon then need to compress myself
  - resize bigger icons?
  - icon file types
    - favour some file types?
    - favor svg over raster images?
- icons http 
  - save http etag or last-modified
    - make own out of content if no http etag or last-modified?
  - only make on request to same domains
- twitch and youtube integration for live streams
  - and for twitch get latest broadcasts
- add transactions
- validate feed tags where needed
  - Need to figure out rules for valid tags
  - Valid tag symbols?:
    - A-z, 0-9
    - no space
  - length limit?
- third party service: https://openrss.org/
- Logo ideas
  - keywords: feed, gaze, rss, atom, links
  - Something with gaze and atoms?

[ ] Can disable updating for feeds?
[ ] Maybe I should add field 'items' to Feed struct?
  - I am using Feed in sqlite db request, which makes the request fail.
    Have separate type for db results?
[ ] For some feeds disable taking newest items. Just take first items as they
appear in the file. 
  - These usually aggregate links from different sites. The  items are in 
    order they were entered. And date (updated_timestamp) is post date.
  - If there is not feed date, what to use? 
  [ ] If implemented have to change how feed.updated_timestamp is updated. Currently
  will used newest (first) feed item.

# Future (Maybe)
[ ] (Popular) Sites that don't support feeds (twitter, instagram, soundcloud).
  [ ] Let user defined 'feed' area?
[ ] Mark feeds to use OS notification system on new link(s)
[ ] Mark feeds that will send email on new link(s)
[ ] For cli UX implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance to print word user might have meant
[ ] UI
  [ ] TUI - NotCurses
    * Example: https://github.com/dundalek/notcurses-zig-example

# Old, done, abandoned
[ ] HTTP ranges: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests
    The RSS url is usually in <head>, but also and be anywhere in the <body>.
    Not sure if it is worth using http ranges.
[ ] UI with [zig-webui](https://github.com/webui-dev/zig-webui)
Tried this and liked it. But I think I can just go with a server. 
[ ] Add http server

[ ] Url rules to transform them into feed urls
  [ ] On some sites have to figure out where to find the feed (reddit, pinboard)
  [ ] Some sites might have and url to rss feed, but page's HTML doesn't contain
      any rss url. Create somekind of rule?
[ ] Atom parsing:
  [ ] see if I need to handle xhtml encoding for <title>
    https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html#text
    <title> can have attribute type which tells how content is encoded.
    Encodings: text (default), html, xhtml
    I think function content_to_str() handles text and html encodings
    in some very general way.
[ ] Reduce how often feed update http request are made
  - increase update interval base on when last update was
    - more than 1 year = several days?
    - more than 1 month = 1 day or more?

feed.updated_timestamp? - is feed element/tag date field or latest (newest) item.updated_timestamp
feed_update.last_update - last time http request was made for feed (200 or 304)
feed_update.update_interval - value from http cache-control or expires. If no value default is used.
item.updated_timestamp? - item's publish date
item.created_timestamp - when item was added
item.item_interval - diff between first and second newest items. Otherwise fallback to default value.

```
with temp_table as (
	select feed.feed_id, coalesce(max(item.updated_timestamp) - 
		(select this.updated_timestamp from item as this where this.feed_id = feed.feed_id order by this.updated_timestamp DESC limit 1, 1), "month"
	) item_interval
	from feed 
	left join item on feed.feed_id = item.feed_id and item.updated_timestamp is not null
	group by item.feed_id
)
update feed_update set item_interval = (
CASE
	when temp_table.item_interval < 86400 then 43200
	when temp_table.item_interval < 172800 then 86400
	when temp_table.item_interval < 604800 then 259200
	when temp_table.item_interval < 2592000 then 432000
	else 864000
end
)
from temp_table where feed_update.feed_id = temp_table.feed_id;
```

[ ] some feed item links just contain url path only
  - get items that start with slash (/): select * from item where link like '/%' order by feed_id
  - if there is only path I should be able to construct full url from feed.feed_url
  - or do I store all feeds with full url?
[ ] website: what to display if items have no date?
  [ ] also feed date
  - frontenddogma.com
  - can use http header last-modified value
